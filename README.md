 Introduction to Cloud Computing and AWS

Explore the basics of cloud computing and get familiar with AWS services and the AWS console.


Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Cloud computing is delivered through a cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users can access services like storage, databases, and computing power from any device with an internet connection. 

Benefits of cloud computing
Cost savings: Users need to only pay for the services that they use. 
Scalability: Users can quickly add or remove resources to meet changing needs. 
Collaboration: Users can work together more easily. 
Faster innovation: Developers can quickly deploy new applications. 
Data loss prevention: Users can back up their data to multiple cloud services.
